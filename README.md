💨 BME680 Environmental Sensor Application for Flipper ZeroThis is a comprehensive environmental monitoring application designed for the Flipper Zero that interfaces with the high-precision BME680 sensor via I2C. The BME680 is a sophisticated environmental sensor capable of measuring temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and air quality (gas resistance).✨ Features Overview🌡️ Sensor MeasurementsThe application provides accurate and real-time readings for a full suite of environmental data:Temperature: Accurate temperature readings in Celsius ($\text{^\circ C}$).Barometric Pressure: Local atmospheric pressure in $\text{hPa}$, with an automatic calculation for Sea-Level Pressure.Humidity: Relative humidity percentage ($\%$).Gas Resistance: Air quality indicator via VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) detection.Dew Point: Automatically calculated using the Magnus formula for meteorological completeness.⚙️ User Interface & ExperienceThe application is designed for clarity, ease of use, and quick access to information:Main Screen: A clean, scrollable card-based interface displaying all sensor readings with custom, informative icons.Settings Menu: A dedicated menu to configure sensor parameters and application preferences.Dark Mode: Optional dark theme for better visibility and a modern look in low-light conditions.Legend Screen: An interactive help screen with $\text{2D}$ panning that explains all custom icons and displays creator information.🔧 Configuration OptionsTailor the application to your specific hardware and location:I2C Address Selection: Toggle between $\text{0x76}$ and $\text{0x77}$ to match your specific sensor module.Gas Sensor Control: Enable/disable the heater element for VOC (air quality) measurements.Altitude Compensation: Set your local altitude ($\text{0-5000m}$) for accurate sea-level pressure calculation.Persistent Settings: All configurations are automatically saved to /ext/apps_data/bme680/config.bin and restored upon startup.💻 Technical Features & RobustnessBuilt for reliability and performance on the Flipper Zero platform:Forced Mode Operation: Sensor operates in forced mode for optimal power efficiency.I2C Communication: Robust $\text{I2C}$ interface with timeout protection.Thread-Safe: Uses mutex protection for concurrent data access, ensuring stability.Error Handling: Comprehensive error checking and logging to aid troubleshooting.Non-blocking UI: Sensor readings are processed in a way that doesn't freeze the user interface.Automatic Directory Creation: Creates necessary directories for configuration storage on the first run.🎨 Custom IconsClear, custom $\text{10x10}$ pixel XBM icons are used for each measurement:IconMeasurementDescription🌡️ThermometerTemperature ($\text{^\circ C}$)📊GaugeBarometric Pressure ($\text{hPa}$)💧DropHumidity ($\%$) / Dew Point ($\text{^\circ C}$)🔥FlameGas Resistance ($\text{k}\Omega$) / Heater Status🕹️ NavigationScreenD-Pad Up/DownD-Pad Left/RightOK ButtonBack ButtonMain ScreenScroll through measurements-Enter SettingsExit applicationSettingsNavigate between optionsAdjust values (e.g., altitude, $\text{I2C}$ address)Select / Toggle optionReturn to Main Screen / Exit application (from Main Menu)LegendPan the contentPan the contentReturn to SettingsReturn to Settings💾 Configuration File DetailsSettings are stored securely in a custom binary format for efficiency:Magic Number Validation: Uses a magic number ($\text{0x42534D45}$, or "BSME") to ensure file integrity.Version Checking: Checks the configuration version for compatibility during load.Automatic Backup and Restore: Ensures settings are persistent and safe.👨‍💻 CreatorThis application was developed by Dr. Mosfet.
