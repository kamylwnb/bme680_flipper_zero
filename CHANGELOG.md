# Changelog

All notable changes to the BME680 Gas Sensor project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2] - 2025-11-09

### Added / Changed
- Commented out the test option in the UI and configuration (code retained, not removed).
- About screen is now scrollable — shows 4 lines per page; navigation: → opens, ↑/↓ scroll pages.
- Set the application author to "Dr.Mosfet" (header and package metadata).
- Simplified code comments and translated them to concise English.
- Added a key press click sound — short A5 (~880 Hz) tone for ~50 ms; louder and more audible.
- Verification: project built and packaged locally (fap) after the changes.

### Notes
- When adding persistent settings (e.g., click volume), it's recommended to bump the configuration version and add migration logic.
